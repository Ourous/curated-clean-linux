definition module Math.Random
/**
* This module provides a pseudo random generator based
* on the Mersenne Twister algorithm
*
* Version 1.0.1 - July 30, 1999 - Thorsten Zoerner
* Catholic University of Nijmegen - zoerner@cs.kun.nl
*
* This implementation is a rewrite of a C program by T. Nishimura
* which can be found in the paper "Mersenne Twister: A 
* 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number 
* generator" by M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura in ACM Transactions 
* on Modeling and Computer Simulation, vol. 8, no. 1, 
* January 1998, pp. 3-30.
*
* The original C code contained the following notice:
*   Copyright (C) 1997 Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.
*   When you use this, send an email to: matumoto@math.keio.ac.jp
