ArgEnv
Version  1.0.3

The ArgEnv package provides a Clean interface to the command line
arguments and the environment variables. 

This is the README for the Unix version. The Unix version has been
tested on Solaris 5.5 and Clean 1.1 & 1.3, but it should work with all
Unix versions with Clean 1.1 or better. To use the package with Clean
version 1.1 you will have to make a few changes, which are documented
in the source.

USAGE

To use the ArgEnv interface you have to link the object module that
is created from the module ArgEnvC.c.
If you use clm you should specify this extra object file with the -l
option:

    % clm -l ArgEnvC.o <your-main-module>

In the CleanIDE you can add this extra object file to the Object
Modules section in the Options->Link Options dialogue.

If you forget this, you will get the link error:
    Undefined                       first referenced
     symbol                             in file

BUGS

There is no way to stop the Clean run-time system from interpreting
some of the command-line arguments.
